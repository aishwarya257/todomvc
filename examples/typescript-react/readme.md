## Features Implemented

1. Updated the packages to the latest version in order to use the latest features of React and Typescript
2. Removed third-party packages with high security risks and included gitignore statements
3. The codebase was not properly architectured. So, changed the folder structure and created reusable components for further use. 
4. To facilitate faster development included build tools like Webpack, Prettier, ESLint and TypeScript configurations
5. Created NPM Script to start the build, so that when more configurations are needed can be easily added.
5. Refactored the entire code base in a better way
6. Implemented the mentioned feature provided in the task.
