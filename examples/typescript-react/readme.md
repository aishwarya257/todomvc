## Features Implemented

1. Updated the packages to the latest version in order to use the latest features of React and Typescript
2. Removed third-party packages with high security risks and included gitignore statements
3. The old codebase was not properly architectured and outdated with old features. So, changed the folder structure, created reusable components and refactored the entire code structure.
4. To facilitate faster development included build tools like Webpack, Prettier, ESLint and TypeScript configurations
5. Created NPM Script to start the build, so that when more configurations are needed can be easily added.
6. Implemented the mentioned feature provided in the email.
